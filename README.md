This is a slot machine game created using JavaScript.

Players can put in an initial amount, assign an amount per row, and bet until the money runs out.

The player wins when they get the same three symbols in a row.

The total winning amount will be a multiplication of the bet per line and the value of the symbol (bet per line * value of the symbol).
